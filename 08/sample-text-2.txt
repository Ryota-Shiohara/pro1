Established in 1858 by Yukichi Fukuzawa as a small school of Western learning, Keio has a history as Japan's very first private institution of higher learning. Over 160 years since its founding, Keio has thrived under its founder's motto of jitsugaku, or empirical science, as it continues to transform Japan as a modern nation through contributions to education, research, and medicine.
